# Organiser-and-Task-Manager
#### Programming Project on Level 4 at Sheffield Hallam Uni.
I worked on this project from Sep 2024 to Dec 2024

###### Project Brief
Our project brief was simple. We needed to create an application that incorporated everything we have learned throughout the module, which was classes, functions and creating a C# console app and Windows Forms App.

###### My Project
We were given some ideas for our project, but could create anything we wanted. I chose to combine two of the ideas, which were the diary/schedule organiser and the to-do and task list.

I created a Windows Forms App, that allows users to: create and manage tasks in a task list, add diary entries into a calendar, and create notes.
